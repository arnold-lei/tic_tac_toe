This is my submission for Tic Tac Toe game. I found myself testing code in different files to see if they would run as expected. I found that often times my syntax was completely off. I also would like to thank emilywyss because I looked at her code whenever I was stuck. It really helped me out and some of the things I did was strucutred off her project.
